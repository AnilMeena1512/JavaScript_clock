# JavaScript_clock

The project basically consist the basics of bootstraps.html,css and JavaScript.
Here I made a clock which shows current time and date using bootstrap.
Fisrtly I went to bootstrap and copied HTML code for Starter Template. After that I copied code from jumbotron  to showcase key marketing messages on our site.
after that i write simple javascript code to get current time and date 
to run the code i used codpen.
